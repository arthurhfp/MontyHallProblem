# MontyHallProblem
This code was made to check the Monty Hall Problem and prove that by changing doors the chance of winning the prize is 66.67% (instead of 50% as the majority of the people think).


The Monty Hall Problem gets its name from the TV game show, Let's Make A Deal, hosted by Monty Hall 1. The scenario is such: you are given the opportunity to select one closed door of three, behind one of which there is a prize. The other two doors hide “goats” (or some other such “non-prize”), or nothing at all. Once you have made your selection, Monty Hall will open one of the remaining doors, revealing that it does not contain the prize 2. He then asks you if you would like to switch your selection to the other unopened door, or stay with your original choice. (https://www.montyhallproblem.com/)
